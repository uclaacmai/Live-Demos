# Live-Demos

As part of our first meeting for the 2017-2018 year, we showed the following live demos. The main purpose was to show people the different advancements made in machine learning over the past few years. 

* Convolutional neural networks - Showed how to load in a trained CNN model in Keras and predict the class category of the image. 

* Fast Style Transfer - Code taken from this [repository](https://github.com/lengstrom/fast-style-transfer). Showed how to take any image, and add styles from famous paintings to those photographs.
